First off, thanks for checking this out. I dont know whats really happening with this, but in time I hope it can turn into something cool. I will add the schematics for assosiated pi and ciruits when I finish them.  


Setup: 
     
      1. https://github.com/getsheked/NHL7Seg/blob/main/README.md
     
      2. Set if you want a 24hr or 12hr (AM/PM) clock. Set the paramater in config to 1 for 24hr and 0 for 12. 
    
      4. Setup Config Timezone
        Enter the UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) offset. For North America, this is usually -5 for EST, -6 for CST, -7 for MST, and -8 for PST.
        If you are in a different timezone, you can find your offset here: https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/ 
        Make sure to check for any daylight savings time changes, as these will affect your offset.
      
      5. Setup teams in config file. 
        Enter the team you want to track and show up on the scoreboard in the config file.
