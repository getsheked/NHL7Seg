First off, thanks for checking this out. I dont know whats really happening with this, but in time I hope it can turn into something cool. I will add the schematics for assosiated pi and ciruits when I finish them, which will happen sometime. No promises on when. 

Setup: 
    1.Set your config file:
      1a. Set if you want a 24hr or 12hr (AM/PM) clock, on mine I am using a 7 segment display so I would reccomend just using a 24hr clock.
      1b. Set if you want a 24hr or 12hr time for the games, for example "Next Game: MIN at DAL 5:00 PM" Or "Next Game MIN at DAL 1700"
      1c. Set the date display, 0 for month-day or 1 for day-month
      1d. Set your team
        Enter the team you want to track and show up on the scoreboard in the config files, these ids can also be seen in the team id json file in the source folder
